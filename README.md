# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. I was provided a template, to save me some time, of a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. In which I choose to start with the template and added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the template.

## TL;DR

To view the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

For the development process, Udacity provided me with a backend server for me to develop with. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods that used to  perform the necessary operations on the backend like [`getAll`] to get all the book, [`update`] to update selection and [`search`] to search for book:

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

I made a pull from the repository where the starter code for _all_ Udacity students is location. After which I made my contribution.

Special thanks to [Ryan Waite] and [Forrest Walker] for doing an Udacity walk Through.
